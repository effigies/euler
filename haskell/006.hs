 - Problem 6
 - The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
 - 1^(2) + 2^(2) + ... + 10^(2) = 385
 -
 - The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
 - (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^(2) = 55^(2) = 3025
 -
 - Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural
 - numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
 -
 - Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred
 - natural numbers and the square of the sum.
